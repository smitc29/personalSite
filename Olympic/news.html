<h4> Hailey Langland Lands First Women's Double Cork At X Games, Wins First Big Air Gold</h4>
	<img src="images/XGames.jpg" class="smallimage" alt="XGames">
	
	<p> As X Games Aspen opened Thursday evening in Colorado, Youth Olympian Hailey Langland demonstrated a cool head that belied 16 years imprinted on the driver's license she took possession of last month, grabbing gold on her final run in the Aspen debut of women's big air snowboarding. The event will makes its Olympic debut next year at the PyeongChang Games.</p>

<p>Pushing off with 10 seconds left in the 25-minute jam session competition format, Langland stuck a front double cork 1080 to pull a score of 49 from the judges, making her the first woman to land a double cork in X Games history.</p>

<p>She finished with a two-run total of 66 points, vaulting past Austria's Anna Gasser to the top of the podium. Gasser has been the rider to beat on this season's world cup circuit, taking three wins and a second this season to sit atop the standings. </p>

<h4> X Games Champions Julia Marino, Hailey Langland Make First Olympic Team In Big Air, Slopestyle Snowboarding</h4>
	<img src="images/Langland_Marino_Qualified.jpg" class="smallimage" alt="Qualified">
	
	<p> Julia Marino and Hailey Langland put it together with everything on the line. </p>

<p> In challenging weather conditions, the two slopestyle snowboarders landed on the podium at the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix and confirmed their spots at the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018. </p>

<p> They join defending Olympic gold medalist Jamie Anderson on the 2018 U.S. Olympic Team, while one more woman will be named to the team via discretion; Jessika Jenson is the favorite for the fourth spot. </p>

<p> Two years ago Marino wasn't someone whose name would have come up in conversation about medal contenders, but she has been tearing it up the past two seasons, including finishing on the podium in three of the five Olympic qualifying events for the joint big air and slopestyle snowboarding Olympic team. </p>

<p> Big air will make its Olympic debut next month, while slopestyle debuted in Sochi four years ago.</p>

<h4> Before They Were 2018 Olympians, 16 U.S. Athletes Were Youth Olympians</h4>
	<img src="images/kim_ferguson_021916_800x375.jpg" class="smallimage" alt="Medals">
	
	<p> Established by the International Olympic Committee in 2007, the Youth Olympic Games is a multi-sport competition for athletes ages 14-17. While competing in many of the traditional Olympic sports, athletes also take part in mixed team events and other activities intended to build camaraderie and understanding amongst one another. And while the events aren't necessarily synonymous with a junior world championship, most come pretty close. So when you put it all together, it's an experience as close to the Olympic Games as there is.</p>

<p>"We went through the same security, we had the same badges, we had the same transportation, we had the same pretty much everything,” luger Tucker West said, noting they also participated in opening and closing ceremonies. “The only thing we were lacking was a big crowd.”</p>

<p>West competed at the first Winter Youth Olympic Games, in 2012 in Innsbruck, Austria. Coming on the heels of the first Youth Olympic Games two years prior in Singapore, the Winter Games were still mostly an unknown quantity even for the athletes. Freeskier Aaron Blunck said he didn’t even know he was eligible for the Youth Olympic Games when he competed at the preceding U.S. championships, but when he got the invite to compete in Innsbruck, he jumped on the opportunity.</p>

<p>In Innsbruck, he won a bronze medal in halfpipe skiing, and two years later he made his full Olympic debut in Sochi, where he finished seventh in the event. Last year, he won X Games.</p>

<p>The Youth Olympic Games, he said, was a uniquely valuable experience.</p>
