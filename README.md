This work is intended as the profile website for Christopher W Smith; you have no permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the code written for this site. Although a code host such as GitHub may allow you to view and fork the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose. No sophisticated software has been used in developing this site, and any external libraries used are likely to be named when relevant. As this is a personal site, no direct profit is expected to be generated from the site's existence, and as a result, there are no ads to provide revenue for this site.
